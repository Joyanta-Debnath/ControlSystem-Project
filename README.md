# ControlSystem-Project
A Control System project using SISO Tool in MATLAB involves designing and analyzing single-input, single-output (SISO) control systems, adjusting parameters like gain, poles, and zeros. It allows users to visualize system performance through Bode plots, root locus, and step response, aiding in controller tuning and optimization.
